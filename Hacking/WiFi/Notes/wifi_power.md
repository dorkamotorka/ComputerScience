# How do we measure WiFi signal strength

- Unit [~range]

- mW (milliwatts) [~ .0001mW - .000000000000001mW]
- dBm (decibel-milliwatts) [~-30dBm - -120dBm]
- RSSI (received signal strength indicator) [Different from manufacturer to manufacturer but ussualy from 0-60 or 0-255]


# What is a good WiFi signal strength?

- -30 dBm = Excellent - Max achievable signal strength. Your device is most likely only a few feet from the AP to achieve this signal. Neither a typical nor desirable in the real world.
- -67 dBm = Very Good - Minimum signal strength for most business applications
- -70 dBm = Okay - Minimum signal strength required for a decent packet delivery.
- -80 dBm = Not Good - Minimum signal strength for basic connectivity. Packet delivery may be unreliable.
- -90 dBm = Unusable - Approaching or drowning in the background transmissions (or noise floor) and is causing serious interference with the signal. Any functionality is highly unlikely.
