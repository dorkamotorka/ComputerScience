## Airmon-ng

Airmon is used to setup the NIC to be in monitor mode. 
Monitor mode is when the NIC is configured such that it is receiving all the wifi packets that are "going through air", independent to which MAC address of NIC it is supposed to be delivered.

It is also used to manage processes that might be interfering the detection.
