Let N be a positive integer.
If a generator for the multiplicative group modulo N exists (for most of the integers N, this is not the case), how many generators does this group have? (EulerPhi(EulerPhi(N))).
1. Find some infinitely many N's sets where a generator for the multiplicative group modulo N does not exist.
2. Find a set of infinitely many N's where a generator for the multiplicative group modulo N exists, and It is easy to prove that there are EulerPhi(EulerPhi(N)) generators.
