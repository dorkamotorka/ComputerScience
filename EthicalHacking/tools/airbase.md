# Airbase

Airbase-ng is used to transform an intruderâ€™s computer to a compromised connection point for others to link to. 
Using Airbase-ng, you can claim to be a legal access point and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on computers that are attached to your network. 
These kinds of attacks are called Evil Twin Attacks. It is impossible for basic users to discern between a legal access point and a fake access point.
